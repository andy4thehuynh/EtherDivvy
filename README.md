## Summary
This smart contract accepts contributions in ETH from people and then divides the ETH up evenly and distributes it to the people who contributed. The maximum contribution per address is 10 ETH and should be configurable, but only be able to be changed by the owner of the contract. The owner should be able to transfer ownership to someone else of their choice.
